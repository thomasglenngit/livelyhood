## _Name of Student_: Thomas Glenn


## _Name of Project_: "LIVELIHOOD" - A Neighborhood Emergency Response Team Application

### Project’s Purpose or Goal: 
* an application to bring neighbors together and serve one another during natural disasters/crises. 

### Execution:
* Volunteers would sign up to offer help in the NERT program (Neighborhood Emergency Response Team) 
* Those in need would post messages to a NERT community board.
* Respondents would offer resources that they could deliver during a disaster. 

### Parameters:
* Each message board would include only those who volunteer.
* The message board is kept private only to participants.
* As a proof of concept, any participant can help any other. Beyond proof of concept, however, ideally, each participant would be limited to serve only those within a one-mile radius (in the interest of safe, walkable delivery).

## Known Bugs:
1.	Sign-In Authorization: Although this is easy to deploy in a React application using Firebase, for some reason my conditional statements are a tad off and I haven’t yet been able to fix them. 
2.	Cards: Every volunteer entry should appear on a card. For some reason, my React Bootstrap nodes are not working as intended. 
3.	Dysfunctional navbar: ‘Sounds like a great band name, or a millennial hangout, but no. Let’s call it a placeholder for the time being. ‘Also fixable by the weekend.
4.	Improved messaging: I tried to deploy a messaging app that would record message conversations in the Firestorm database. It did not work as planned, so I used Stream. It’s super quick to get going, but I haven’t yet customized it, nor have I yet figured out how to record the messages in Firebase.
5.	Asset Tracker: I went with the standard Google Maps API, though it is my intention to replace it with Google Maps Asset Tracker, so that volunteers could keep track of their tools. If I were to flesh this out as desired, I would include a tool lending library.
