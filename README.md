## _Name of Student_: Thomas Glenn

## _Name of Project_: "LIVELIHOOD" - A Neighborhood Emergency Response Team Application

### Project’s Purpose or Goal: 
* an application to bring neighbors together and serve one another during natural disasters/crises. 

### Execution:
* Users would sign up to offer help in the NERT program (Neighborhood Emergency Response Team) 
* Those in need would post messages to a NERT community board.
* Respondents would offer resources that they could deliver during a disaster. 

### Parameters:
* Each message board would include only those who volunteer.
* The message board is kept private only to participants.
* As a proof of concept, any participant can help any other. Beyond proof of concept, however, ideally, each participant would be limited to serve only those within a one-mile radius (in the interest of safe, walkable delivery).

# Minimum features to meet this goal include: 
* Sign-up form, including name and address
* Authentication
* Authorization
* List of participants with skills and tools offered, stored in a NoSQL database using google firebase.
* CRUD functionality in place to Create, Read, Update, Delete members on the stored list.

Tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources to create this MVP:
* REACT with Redux for front end and back end .
* CSS grid for REACT to style pages. 
* NoSQL database using Google Firebase to store form entries.
* Google Maps API, to plot a map of people within a community willing to help. Or
* Google Maps API, for IoT asset tracking - to monitor locations of tools, vehicles, etc. 
* “AuthO” Authorization API, or a simple Identity - Authentication to protect the identities of participants.

hello


Beyond the MVP, I would hope to build this application into a mobile application. If I were to really dream big, I would create an open source platform for this idea, or even propose to a venture firm as a start-up idea. Then, I would hire all my May cohort friends to help build this out. Long term I would love to do the following: 

* Curate a chat room where participants can log service requests and where community members can meet those requests, likely using a platform like STREAM.
* build a tool lending library into the app for people in need to borrow tools and track them using google asset tracking.
* build an attractive user interface using PROCREATE
* investigate applying this application to a mobile platform, like iOS.

Is there anything else you’d like your instructor to know?
* I have changed my mind, choosing now to build this program using React.JS, instead of C# ASP.Net MVC, simply because, long term, I intend to build this project into a mobile iOS appliction. I feel there is more mobile accessibility using REACT. Am I wrong about this? I also feel that, whether I use React.JS or .Net, I am jumping into the "deep end" no matter what. So, I might as well learn as much as I can. 
* I love code.
